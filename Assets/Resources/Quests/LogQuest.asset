    - Some of the logs I was going to chop into firewood seem to be missing and the
      log piles are all a mess
    - "I would think a bear might have disturbed the piles, but why would it take
      the logs and there aren\u2019t any tracks of a bear"
    - How odd?
    - Any how, would you kindly have a look around and round them up

    - Is that all that you could find? There should be more.
